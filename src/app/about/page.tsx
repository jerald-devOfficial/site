            TindaMo was born from a simple observation: people have things they
            don&apos;t need, and there are others nearby who need exactly those
            things. Yet connecting these neighbors remained surprisingly
            difficult in our increasingly digital world.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            Founded in 2025, TindaMo bridges this gap by creating a hyper-local
            marketplace that brings communities together through trade, barter,
            and meaningful exchanges. We believe that the best deals aren&apos;t
            just about price ‚Äì they&apos;re about building connections with the
            people around you.
